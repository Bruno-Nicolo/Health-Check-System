# SysScanner 🚨

Software engineering course project.

### Introduction

SysScanner is designed to monitor vital parameters of your PC to ensure optimal performance and prevent critical failures. With SysScanner, you can monitor key components such as **RAM**, **CPU**, **disk space**, **processes**, **network speed** and some **general information**. This simple, yet effective, monitoring system allows users to set **customizable thresholds** for each component, ensuring alerts and recurring notifications when critical issues arise. ⚠️

Additionally, SysScanner includes a **Telegram bot integration**, known as [SysScanner Bot](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@SysScanner_bot), which facilitates instant notifications to users when thresholds are exceeded. 📲 This ensures you are always informed of your system's health, no matter where you are.
